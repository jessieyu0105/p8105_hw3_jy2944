Problem 1
=========

This problem uses the BRFSS data.

### Load data and do some data cleaning

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # format the data to use appropriate variable names
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state_str", "location"), sep = " - ") %>%
  select(-state_str) %>%
  rename(state_abbr = locationabbr) %>%
  # focus on "Overall Health" topic
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  # remove the variables which I do not need
  select(-(class:question), 
         -sample_size, 
         -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>%
  # organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from "Excellent" to "Poor"
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(factor(response), c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

### Answers based on the dataset

*1. In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?*

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  # filter by year
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  # group by state
  group_by(state_abbr) %>% 
  # summarize number of locations in each state
  summarise(n_location = n_distinct(location)) %>% 
  filter(n_location == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state\_abbr |  n\_location|
|:------------|------------:|
| CT          |            7|
| FL          |            7|
| NC          |            7|

From above table, we find that Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina were observed at 7 loacations in 2002.

*2. Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.*

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  # group by year and state
  group_by(year, state_abbr) %>% 
  # find the number of distinct location in each year
  distinct(location) %>% 
  summarise(number = n()) %>% 
  # spaghetti plot
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = number, color = state_abbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
   labs(
    title = "Number of locations in each State from 2002 to 2010", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Number of locations",
    # change the legend name
    color = "State"
    ) 
```

We can learn from the above plot that there existed a state being observed quite a lot distinct locations in year 2007 and 2010 (more than 40 locations), but it is difficult to distinguish which state it is from this spaghetti plot. Thus, let us use the following code chunk to find out it.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, state_abbr) %>% 
  distinct(location) %>% 
  summarise(number = n()) %>%
  filter(year == 2007 | year == 2010) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number)) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

|  year| state\_abbr |  number|
|-----:|:------------|-------:|
|  2007| FL          |      44|
|  2010| FL          |      41|
|  2010| NJ          |      19|
|  2007| NJ          |      16|
|  2010| TX          |      16|

We get to know from the above table that Florida is the very state being observed more than 40 locations in year 2007 and 2010.

*3. Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.*

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  # filter year
  filter(year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>% 
  # filter NY
  filter(state_abbr == "NY") %>% 
  # filter "Excellent"
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  # group by state and year
  group_by(state_abbr, year) %>% 
  summarize(
    excellent_mean = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE),
    excellent_sd = sd(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| state\_abbr |  year|  excellent\_mean|  excellent\_sd|
|:------------|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
| NY          |  2002|            24.04|           4.49|
| NY          |  2006|            22.53|           4.00|
| NY          |  2010|            22.70|           3.57|

The above table suggests: among the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean of the proportion of "Excellent" responses in NY state was highest in year 2002 (24.04%), and lowest in year 2006 (22.53%); the varibility of the proportion was biggest in year 2002 (±4.49%) and smallest in year 2010 (±3.57%).

*4. For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.*

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  # group by year, state, and response
  group_by(year, state_abbr, response) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  # Boxplot, group by year
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "State-level average proportion in each response category from 2002 to 2010", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Average Proportion"
    ) +
  # faceting: divide the plot into 5 subplots based on response category
  facet_grid(. ~ response) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

![](p8105_hw3_jy2944_files/figure-markdown_github/p1_4-1.png)

In each response category, the distributions of state-level average proportion are not much different between years, but the occurance of outliers is different in each year. There are more outliers appeared in the "Poor" response category compared to other category.
